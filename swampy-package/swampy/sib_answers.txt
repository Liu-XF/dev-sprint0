Please write your responses to the following in the sib_answers.txt file.
Why would refactoring be useful?
 Answer: To make codes more readable, and easier to be reused by other functions
What would the code change be to make the house appear twice as high given the latest version of the refactor_example script?
 Answer: change line 27, 30, 32, 34  4*size â€”> 8*size
What would the code change look like if we had never made a draw_house method that took size as a parameter (no need to actually write it, just explain what it would entail)?
 Answer: in that case, to draw a house at different size, all step sizes need to be recalculated.



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:
     import all functions from TurtleWorld
     new object of class TurtleWorld
     new object of class Turtle 
     wait for further command




These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:number of sides, integer

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer:fd : moving forward
       lt: left turn

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: Turtle (object), number of polygon (integer), step size, turn angle
 
Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: bk(radius)
        lt()
        circle ()

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: 

-- What is this type of requirement called?
